# imgd-4000-other-projects


This is a collection of other projects completed in unreal engine 4 for my IMGD-4000 including an implemention of A* pathfiding + smoothing for real time navigation to find the optimal route from point A to B around obstacles, an implementation of basic physics via a canon ball shooting mini-game (think angry birds), and a basic 2D twin stick shooter.
